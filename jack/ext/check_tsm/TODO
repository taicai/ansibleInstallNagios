number of scratch in relation to max scratch per storage pool, check in % or number
check other tsm scripts on nagiosexchange

non-normal client schedules (failed, missed, running, ...)

allow number of volumes in %?

volumes needing reclamation should report total number of volumes as well (somehow)

run commands from script, with one query on each line

improve command and output processing like tsmmon. this would fix 'order' issue with requests

|allow grouping of commands, and specified -w and -c, e.g. check_tsm ... -wW1 -cC1 drives -wW2 -cC2 paths

|implement "requests" check: number of active requests (>0=warning, >1=critical)
